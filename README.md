# Rust Binary Visualizer 🦀

A high-performance, interactive web tool designed to visualize the conversion logic between Decimal and Binary numbers. Built using **Rust** and **WebAssembly (Wasm)** to demonstrate how low-level logic can run natively in the browser.

## ✨ Features

* **Bi-Directional Conversion**: Type in Decimal to get Binary, or Binary to get Decimal.
* **Visual Learning**:
    * **Decimal ➔ Binary**: Shows the "Repeated Division by 2" method with step-by-step calculations.
    * **Binary ➔ Decimal**: Shows "Bit Cards" ($2^0, 2^1, \dots$) lighting up to represent the sum.
* **Math Validation**: Includes a total summation view ($\Sigma$) to verify the result.
* **Safety**: Uses Rust's type safety and pattern matching to prevent errors (e.g., handling invalid binary inputs gracefully).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Core Logic**: Rust (v1.75+)
* **Compilation**: `wasm-pack` (compiles Rust to WebAssembly)
* **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES Modules)
* **Bridge**: `wasm-bindgen` (Connects Rust functions to JS)

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the project locally.

### 1. Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
* Rust & Cargo (`curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh`)
* wasm-pack (`curl https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/installer/init.sh -sSf | sh`)
* Python 3 (pre-installed on Linux/WSL for the local server)

### 2. Installation
Clone the repo (or navigate to your project folder):
```bash
cd binary-viz
```

### 3. Build the Project
Compile the Rust code into WebAssembly. This generates the `pkg/` folder containing the `.wasm` binary and JavaScript glue code.

```bash
wasm-pack build --target web
```

### 4. Run Locally
Browsers block Wasm from running directly via file paths (`file://`) for security reasons. You must use a local web server to view the project.

Since you likely have Python installed, run this command in your project folder:

```bash
python3 -m http.server
```

Open your browser and navigate to: http://localhost:8000

## 🌍 Deployment

### Option 1: Vercel (Recommended)
Vercel is the easiest way to deploy, but there is one critical step: **You must ensure the `pkg` folder is uploaded to GitHub.**

By default, `.gitignore` often blocks build artifacts. You need to force-add it so Vercel can see your compiled code.

1.  **Force add the pkg folder:**
    ```bash
    git add -f pkg
    git commit -m "Force add compiled wasm"
    git push origin main
    ```
2.  **Import into Vercel:**
    * Go to Vercel dashboard -> Add New Project.
    * Import your `binary-viz` repository.
    * **Root Directory:** Ensure this matches your project folder name if it's inside a larger repo.
    * **Build Command:** Leave empty (Vercel automatically detects it as a static site).
    * **Output Directory:** Leave empty.

### Option 2: GitHub Pages
1.  Go to your Repository Settings -> **Pages**.
2.  Select the `main` branch as the source.
3.  Save.

## 📂 Project Structure

* `src/lib.rs` - **Rust Backend**: Handles math logic and HTML string generation.
* `index.html` - **Frontend**: Handles UI, input events, and CSS styling.
* `pkg/` - **Compiled Output**: The Wasm binary and JS wrapper (generated by `wasm-pack`).
* `Cargo.toml` - **Manifest**: Configuration for dependencies and build settings.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

**"Nothing happens when I type!"**
1.  Open your browser console (**F12**).
2.  If you see `404 Not Found .../pkg/binary_viz.js`:
    * **Locally:** You likely forgot to run `wasm-pack build --target web`.
    * **On Vercel:** You likely forgot to `git add -f pkg` before pushing, so the server doesn't have the file.
